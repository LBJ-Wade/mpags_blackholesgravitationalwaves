# PhD class "Black Holes and Gravitational Waves"
### University of Birmingham and MPAGS

[MPAGS website](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/mpags/modules/astro/blackhole)


**Lecturers:** Dr. Christopher Moore (part I), Dr. [Davide Gerosa](http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/~dgerosa/) (part II) and Dr. Patricia Schmidt (part III)

### 2020 Schedule. 
Start: 1/10/2020

Thursdays 2:00-3:00

Zoom link will be circulated by email.

### Module Details
 
There will be nine 1 hour lectures spread throughout the term. The course will conclude with a 1 day residential workshop in Birmingham which will elaborate on some of the topics covered with practical numerical calculations performed using Python.


**Prerequisites**: General knowledge of tensor and vector calculus at the level of a typical undergraduate course will be assumed. A basic knowledge of the Python language is required for the 1 day workshop at the end of the course (if the students have no previous python experience they could attend the Python MPAGS course which runs concurrently with this course).

 

## Course Outline:

 

### Part I: Christopher Moore (lectures 1-3)

The first module will give an overview of some of the mathematical background to general relativity: manifolds, the metric, tensors, covariant derivatives, the Riemannian curvature. We will then cover the linearised Einstein field equations and the Schwarzschild solution.

### Part II: Davide Gerosa (lectures 4-6)

This module covers the basics of gravitational wave emission and propagation: linearization of the Einstein field equations, their Newtonian limit, and the gravitational-wave quadrupole formula. We then apply this formalism to the specific case of binary black holes and highlight their astrophysical relevance.

### Part III: Patricia Schmidt (lectures 7-9)

This part of the course will give a basic introduction to numerical relativity - the field of solving Einsteinâ€™s field equations numerically. We will cover the 3+1 decomposition of the field equations, briefly introduce gauge conditions and initial data for black hole spacetimes, before looking at the evolution of black hole spacetimes and gravitational wave extraction.

 

### Final Workshop:

The course will conclude with an interactive, hands-on workshop, which will provide provide a taste of current gravitational-wave data-analysis methods.
 

### Assessment:

The course will be assessed via 3 short example sheets (one for each part of the course) which students can complete in their own time and submit online to the lecturer.

### Past editions:

Materials from previous editions remains available in dedicated branches of this repository.
